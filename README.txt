1. Introduction to SQL

Overview of SQL

SQL's role in Relational Databases

SQL Standards (ANSI SQL)


2. SQL Basics

SQL Syntax & Structure

Common Keywords: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE


3. Data Types

Numeric: INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL

String: CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT

Date/Time: DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP

Boolean: BOOLEAN


4. Basic SQL Queries

SELECT: Querying data

WHERE: Filtering data

ORDER BY: Sorting data

LIMIT: Limiting results

DISTINCT: Removing duplicates


5. Joins

INNER JOIN: Matching records from both tables

LEFT JOIN: All records from the left table, matched records from the right

RIGHT JOIN: All records from the right table, matched records from the left

FULL OUTER JOIN: All records when there's a match in either table

CROSS JOIN: Cartesian product of both tables

SELF JOIN: Joining a table with itself


6. Subqueries

Simple Subqueries: Nested queries returning single values

Correlated Subqueries: Subqueries dependent on outer queries

EXISTS: Testing for the existence of rows


7. Aggregate Functions

COUNT(): Counting rows

SUM(): Summing values

AVG(): Calculating averages

MIN(): Minimum value

MAX(): Maximum value


8. Grouping & Filtering Data

GROUP BY: Grouping rows by column values

HAVING: Filtering groups

ROLLUP/CUBE: Advanced grouping options


9. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

INSERT: Inserting data into tables

UPDATE: Modifying existing data

DELETE: Removing data

TRUNCATE: Clearing all rows from a table


10. Data Definition Language (DDL)

CREATE TABLE: Creating a new table

ALTER TABLE: Modifying a table

DROP TABLE: Deleting a table

RENAME TABLE: Changing a tableâ€™s name


11. Constraints

PRIMARY KEY: Unique identifier for rows

FOREIGN KEY: Enforcing referential integrity between tables

UNIQUE: Ensuring all values are unique

NOT NULL: Preventing null values

CHECK: Ensuring data meets specific conditions

DEFAULT: Default values for a column


12. Indexes

Purpose: Improving query performance

Types:

Single Column Index

Composite Index

Unique Index



13. Views

Definition: Virtual tables based on a query

Creating Views: CREATE VIEW

Modifying Views: ALTER VIEW

Dropping Views: DROP VIEW


14. Transactions

ACID Properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

Commands: BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK

SAVEPOINT: Setting a rollback point within a transaction


15. Cursors

Definition: A database object used to retrieve a set of rows one at a time

Syntax:

DECLARE CURSOR: Declaring the cursor with a SELECT statement

OPEN CURSOR: Opening the cursor to process rows

FETCH CURSOR: Retrieving rows one at a time

CLOSE CURSOR: Closing the cursor after operations


Use Case: Handling row-by-row processing when complex data manipulation is needed


16. Stored Procedures and Functions

Stored Procedures: Reusable SQL code blocks

User-defined Functions (UDFs): Functions returning single values

IN/OUT Parameters: Passing parameters to procedures


17. Triggers

Definition: Automatic actions executed when certain events occur

Types: BEFORE INSERT, AFTER INSERT, BEFORE UPDATE, etc.

Use Cases: Auditing, data validation


18. Temporary Tables

Definition: Tables created temporarily in a session that get dropped automatically when the session ends

Syntax:

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table_name (column definitions);


Usage: Store intermediate results during complex queries or data processing

Scope: Exists only during the current session


19. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Definition: Temporary result sets that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement

Syntax: WITH cte_name AS (SELECT column1 FROM table WHERE condition) SELECT * FROM cte_name;

Recursive CTEs: Used for hierarchical data processing


20. User and Access Control

User Management: CREATE USER, DROP USER

Granting Privileges: GRANT command

Revoking Privileges: REVOKE command

Role-based Permissions: Assigning roles to users


21. Database Normalization

1NF: Eliminate repeating groups

2NF: Eliminate partial dependencies

3NF: Eliminate transitive dependencies

Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): Further refining tables

Higher Normal Forms: 4NF, 5NF for advanced normalization


22. Denormalization

Purpose: Improving query performance by introducing redundancy

Use Cases: Optimizing read-heavy workloads


23. Schema Design

Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs): Visualizing database structure

Normalization vs Denormalization: When to apply each

One-to-Many, Many-to-Many Relationships: Representing relationships between tables


24. Advanced SQL Concepts

Window Functions: Perform calculations over a set of rows related to the current row

Examples: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), LEAD(), LAG()


Recursive CTEs: Handling hierarchical data

Full-Text Search: Searching for keywords in text columns

Pivot/Unpivot: Transforming rows into columns and vice versa


25. Performance Tuning

Query Optimization: Writing efficient queries

Indexes: Use of appropriate indexing strategies

EXPLAIN/EXPLAIN PLAN: Understanding the execution plan of queries

Caching: Leveraging database caching for frequent queries


26. Backup and Recovery

Backup Strategies: Full, incremental, differential backups

Point-in-Time Recovery: Restoring databases to a specific time

Disaster Recovery Planning: Strategies for ensuring data integrity


27. NoSQL and SQL

SQL vs NoSQL: Understanding the differences

When to use SQL vs NoSQL: Use cases for each approach

JSON in SQL: Storing and querying JSON data within relational databases
